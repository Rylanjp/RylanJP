# Howdy, My name is Rylan Powell ü§†

I am a Texas-based professional with a diverse background in security and sales. Over the years, I‚Äôve honed my skills in both business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) environments, enabling me to build strong relationships and drive results. Recently, I‚Äôve embarked on an exciting new journey of learning to code, with a focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as I explore the world of web development. Outside of work, I‚Äôm passionate about cooking, video games, reading, spending time outdoors and with my amazing girlfriend. I‚Äôm always looking to combine my analytical mindset and creativity to solve problems and grow both professionally and personally.
